Hi 
I have been recently trying to test my C skill and improve it and this is the output. It is not usable at all and not userfiendly but and i think using C in Software developing is a NOGO but having challenges can be fun. I hope you can deal with it:)

First of all you will see the menu with 5 options and for 5th option which is exit i have decided to use an assembly instruction which is very direct and amazing. The other options are working with data and database even using  simple sqlite couldn't
simplify the whole picture but more complex :))

- But at least you can save one name and the age of one student per action. 
- The load function will show the entire Database
- Delete and search functionalities have still some bugs and i am on it trying to inject it to fix them ....
